    <h2 class="text-red-500 font-bold text-3xl mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-700">
        I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Central Florida, pursuing my degree since 2020. 
        Through both academic work and hands-on experience, I've developed strong skills in software development, 
        hardware integration, and problem-solving.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Before transitioning fully into engineering, I worked as an after-school care manager where I led a team 
        of five to ten staff members. That experience strengthened my leadership, communication, and teamwork 
        abilities—qualities that continue to guide my approach to engineering projects today.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-700 mt-4">
        As a freelance software engineer and IT professional, I've collaborated with multiple clients on both 
        new and ongoing projects, providing solutions in web development, systems integration, and technical 
        troubleshooting. Beyond client work, I'm passionate about personal projects involving PCB design, 
        software engineering, and website development, where I continually explore new ways to merge creativity 
        with technology.
